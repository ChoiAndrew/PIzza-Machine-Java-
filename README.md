# PIzza-Machine-Java-
This project is suppose to code a vending machine for fresh pizzas
In this assignment, we’ll tie together multiple software techniques we’ve learned throughout the quarter.We’ll reuse our Fractions, Shapes, 
and otherclasses as well asour data structures to build a fully functioning pizza sales simulatorprogram that would power a vending machine
similar to what’s pictured.

Top-Down Design & Stepwise Refinement
In each section, we’ll build components of our Pizza Simulator one piece at a time, building each component in steps.  By refining each component in stages, we can incrementally build logic and test it in isolation as we progress, before combining the components into our complete Pizza solution.  We’ll often start by examining an inheritance hierarchy and realizing that hierarch in Java code by building each class one at a time, starting with parent classes.  This approach essentially captures the “big picture” first (the top levels or classes in our inheritance hierarchy), and fills in the specific details as you flesh out classes farther and farther down the hierarchy.   We can also build each class using a “Top-Down” approach where we first define each method we are to have as empty stubs and verify this compiles with the driver, and then fill in the missing details in each function as you progress.  In each of the examples, you’re starting with a broad picture that lacks details just like the first few iterations of your Top-Down Stepwise Refinement exercises using pseudocode.  As build each method and class, you move your overall solution ahead one or more steps while practicing software design techniques called Top-Down Designand Stepwise Refinement.

Invariants
1.When a Pizza is made, it starts with 100% of it’s area left (soa Fraction of 1/1)2.A Pizza’s remaining ratio must be between (0,1] excluding 0 and including 1.3.When a Pizza’s fractionRemaining reaches 0, that Pizza is removed from the list of Pizzasa.If a Pizza’s remaining fraction is less than 0, throw an exception asthis is an error caseb.If a Pizza’s remaining fraction is equal to 0, throw an exception that is caught by your Manager and remove that eaten pizza from the list.4.A Pizza’s price is the sum of its ingredients’ costs.a.Thus, calling addIngredient() on a Pizza changes the cost of the pizza.5.A Pizza’s calorie count is the sum of its ingredients’ calories.a.So, calling addIngredient() on a Pizza changes the calorie total for the pizza.b.This is a serving size, and so the pizza’s calories will never change as the pizza is being eaten –this is the per slice “serving size”.6.Ingredient is Immutable (all data items are final)7.Fraction is Immutable, just as we have done before.8.Fraction implements Comparable9.Shape will implement Cloneable but define the method as abstract10.Adding ingredients will add the price of a Pizza11.Reducing the remaining Fraction of pizza left will reduce the price of the Pizza accordinglya.Square and Circle will implement the clone methods to override the abstract superclass clone12.All Pizzas have a TimeStamp that indicates when they were created.  a.You can use the current date and time when a Pizza is built, or use random values for the time and date the pizza was made.
